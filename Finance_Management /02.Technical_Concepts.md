1. Compute Usage Commitment: hrly $ amt that we agree to spend on eligible services over 1 yr, 3yr term. Measured in dollars per hr, not specific instance types or quantities.
2. Savings Plan types: Compute Savings Plans(EC2,fargate, Lambda), EC2 Instance Savings Plans(Provides higher discount but just in EC2), and SageMaker Savings Plans(just sagemaker).
3. Payment:All Upfront, Partial Upfront, and No Upfront.
4. Utilization Metrics: How effextively resources are used (rate below 100%, you are paying for what you are'nt using)
5. Coverage Metrics: indicate what percentage of your eligible usage is covered by Savings Plans, helps identify opportunities for additional cost savings.
6. Commitment Sharing: Allows Savings Plans discounts to apply across multiple accounts within an organization(a Savings Plan purchased in a management account automatically applies to eligible usage in all linked accounts. )
7. Amortization : display your costs with amortized Savings Plans, showing how the upfront payment or hourly commitment is distributed across your actual usage.
8. Unused commitment: when your eligible usage falls below your committed amount. Tracking this metric helps you identify patterns and adjust your resource usage or future commitments to minimize waste.
